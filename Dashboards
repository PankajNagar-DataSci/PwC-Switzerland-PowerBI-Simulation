# 📊 PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation | Forage  

This repository contains my work from the **PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Experience** on Forage, where I built interactive dashboards to analyze customer churn and business insights. Using **Power BI**, I explored retention trends, payment methods, contract types, demographics, and service usage to identify key churn drivers. I applied **DAX calculations**, created **interactive filters**, and developed **data-driven visualizations** to support decision-making.  

## 📌 Dashboards Overview  

✅ **Customer Retention Dashboard** – Analyzed churn trends, customer tenure, and retention KPIs to provide actionable insights.  
✅ **Churn Analysis Dashboard** – Examined the impact of payment methods, contract types, and billing preferences on customer churn.

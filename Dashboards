# 📊 PwC Switzerland Power BI Job Simulation | Forage  

This repository contains my work from the **PwC Switzerland Power BI Virtual Experience** on Forage, where I built interactive dashboards to analyze customer churn and business insights. Using **Power BI**, I explored retention trends, payment methods, contract types, demographics, and service usage to identify key churn drivers. I applied **DAX calculations**, created **interactive filters**, and developed **data-driven visualizations** to support decision-making.
